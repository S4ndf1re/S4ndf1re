### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan and I am currently working on my Bachelor of Engineering Student at the University of Applied sciences and Arts in Bielefeld, Germany.
I am interested in a lot of topics of development, including programming languages like Rust, Go, or technologies like Search Engines, Compilers, AI and a lot of other topics.
